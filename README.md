# My Onepager about Myself

#### Video explaining the project: https://youtu.be/EeQ-yRC4PEQ

#### Overview

This is my first attempt at developing a web page from scratch, using Bootstrap framework and the knowledge I acquired on Harvard's CS50 course, as well as my own research online.
I wanted to go out of my confort zone and do something I've never done before, to prove to myself and others that I can pick up on new subjects quickly and produce a quality outcome. Also, I thought I could join this eager to learn something new with a need of having a webpage that I can post my articles and data science projects once I start doing them. This will help me put my ideas out there and start to interact with other data scientists to learn more and innovate on the field.
In the future, I'll add more pages on the website, to actually hold blog posts, discuss a little bit about my journey to become a data scientist, as well as a page to show to the world my hobbies and my family.

#### Files
In this repository, you'll find a file that holds all my HTML code, a CSS stylesheet that contains all my personal tweaks when not using the standard Bootstrap classess and styles, a JavaScript script file that contains specifically code to shrink the navbar in the top, this readme file, and all the images I used on the page.
